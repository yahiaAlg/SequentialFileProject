# **Sequential File Implementation**

## **Introduction**

Sequential files are fundamental in data management, providing efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms. This project implements sequential files with dynamic memory and persistence support, allowing for robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The implementation supports flexible configurations for handling records and blocks, including features like:

- **Block Organization**: Contiguous (Table) or Linked (List).
- **Order**: Ordered or Unordered records.
- **Record Size**: Fixed or Variable-sized records.
- **Overlap**: Records spanning multiple blocks (Continued) or fully contained within a block (Not Continued).

The program also features a **menu-driven interface** for user interaction, enabling operations like record insertion, updates, deletion, and file persistence on disk.

---

## **Features**

1. **CRUD Operations**:

   - **Insert**: Add new records to the sequential file.
   - **Read**: Display all records or search for a specific record.
   - **Update**: Modify an existing record by its ID.
   - **Delete**: Logically delete a record by marking it as removed.

2. **Persistence**:

   - Save the file to disk in a binary format.
   - Load the file from disk for future use.
   - Delete the binary file from disk.

3. **Configurable File Structure**:

   - Contiguous (Table) or Linked (List) blocks.
   - Ordered or Unordered records.
   - Fixed or Variable record sizes.
   - Support for records with or without block overlap.

4. **Utility Functions**:
   - Print the file in a human-readable tabular format.
   - Binary search for records in ordered files.
   - Logical deletion of records.

## **Data Structures**

### **Record**

Represents a single logical entry in the sequential file.

```c
typedef struct {
    int id;           // Unique identifier
    char *data;       // Dynamically allocated record data
    int size;         // Size of the record (for variable-length records)
} Record;
```

### **Block**

Represents a fixed-size storage unit containing records.

```c
typedef struct Block {
    char *data;         // Block data (dynamically allocated)
    int blockSize;      // Size of the block
    int freeSpace;      // Remaining space in the block
    struct Block *next; // Pointer to the next block (for linked structures)
} Block;
```

### **Sequential File**

Represents the entire sequential file system, managing blocks and records.

```c
typedef struct {
    Block *head;       // Pointer to the first block
    int blockSize;     // Size of each block
    int isContiguous;  // 1 for Table, 0 for List
    int isOrdered;     // 1 for Ordered, 0 for Unordered
    int isFixed;       // 1 for Fixed, 0 for Variable
    int allowOverlap;  // 1 for Continued, 0 for Not Continued
} SequentialFile;
```

## **Menu-Driven Operations**

The program provides the following menu options:

| **Option** | **Operation**          | **Description**                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Insert Record          | Add a new record to the sequential file.                       |
| 2          | Read All Records       | Display all records in a human-readable format.                |
| 3          | Read a Specific Record | Search for a record by ID (using binary or sequential search). |
| 4          | Update a Record        | Modify an existing record by its ID.                           |
| 5          | Delete a Record        | Logically delete a record by its ID.                           |
| 6          | Save File to Disk      | Save the current file to disk in binary format.                |
| 7          | Load File from Disk    | Load the sequential file from a previously saved binary file.  |
| 8          | Delete File from Disk  | Delete the binary file from disk.                              |
| 9          | Exit                   | Exit the program and free all allocated resources.             |

# **Sequential File Database Implementation**

## **Introduction**

This project provides a modular and extensible implementation of a **sequential file database**, offering features like dynamic memory management, persistence, CRUD operations, and support for various file configurations (e.g., block organization, order, and record size). It serves as a lightweight database-like system for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting records efficiently.

---

## **Features**

1. **CRUD Operations**:

   - **Insert**: Add new records.
   - **Read**: Retrieve all records or search for specific records.
   - **Update**: Modify existing records by ID.
   - **Delete**: Logically remove records by marking them as deleted.

2. **Persistence**:

   - Save the file to disk in binary format.
   - Load the file back from disk for later use.
   - Delete the saved binary file.

3. **Utility Functions**:

   - Print the file contents in a human-readable tabular format.
   - Binary search for records in ordered files.

4. **Configurable Structure**:

   - Contiguous (Table) or Linked (List) blocks.
   - Ordered or Unordered records.
   - Fixed or Variable-sized records.
   - Support for records spanning multiple blocks (overlap).

5. **Extensibility**:
   - Easily redefine the record structure for various use cases (e.g., student records).

---

## **Program Flow**

1. **Initialization**:

   - The sequential file is created with user-defined settings for block size, ordering, record format, and overlap.

2. **CRUD Operations**:

   - The user interacts with the program through a menu-driven interface, selecting operations like inserting records, reading data, updating records, or deleting them.

3. **Data Management**:

   - Records are stored dynamically in blocks, with intelligent handling of space allocation and overlap.
   - Operations like updating or logical deletion modify records in memory.

4. **Persistence**:

   - Save the in-memory file to disk for later retrieval.
   - Load previously saved files into memory for operations.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - Easily adapt the record structure to different use cases by updating the `Record` structure and associated CRUD logic.

### **How to Modify for Custom Records**

To adapt the program for different record types (e.g., student records), follow these steps:

1. **Update the `Record` Structure**:
   Modify `record.h` to include fields specific to the new use case:

   ```c
   typedef struct {
       int id;           // Unique identifier
       char name[50];    // Student's name
       float gpa;        // Student's GPA
       int age;          // Student's age
   } Record;
   ```

2. **Adjust CRUD Functions**:
   Update the `insertRecord`, `printFile`, `updateRecord`, and `binarySearchInFile` functions to handle the new fields.

3. **Update Display Logic**:
   Modify `printFile` to display the additional fields in a tabular format:

   ```c
   printf("| %-10d | %-20s | %-5.2f | %-3d |\n", record->id, record->name, record->gpa, record->age);
   ```

4. **Recompile the Project**:
   Use `make` to rebuild the program:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make
   ```

## **Conclusion**

This sequential file implementation is versatile, extensible, and ideal for various record-based applications. Whether you need to manage student records, inventory data, or other structured information, this project provides a robust starting point.
