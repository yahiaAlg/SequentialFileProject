When storing sequential files on a disk, several factors come into play to ensure efficient use of storage space and fast access to data. Here's a breakdown of how sequential files are saved to disk, step by step:

---

### **1. Disk Organization**

Disks are organized into **sectors**, which are grouped into **blocks** (the basic unit of data transfer between memory and disk). Sequential files are stored as a sequence of these blocks.

#### **Structure of a Disk**

```
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|      Block 1         |      Block 2         |      Block 3         |
| [Sector 1][Sector 2] | [Sector 3][Sector 4] | [Sector 5][Sector 6] |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
```

- **Sectors:** The smallest physical unit of storage, typically 512 bytes or 4 KB.
- **Blocks:** Logical grouping of sectors for efficient data handling, typically 4 KB or 8 KB.

---

### **2. Writing Sequential Files to Disk**

Sequential files are saved as a series of contiguous or logically linked blocks on the disk.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Data Division:**
   - The file is divided into **records**.
   - Records are grouped into **blocks**.
2. **Allocation:**
   - A disk block is allocated for each group of records.
   - Contiguous allocation (preferred for performance) or linked allocation is used.
3. **Saving:**
   - Each block is written to a specific location on the disk.

---

#### **3. Contiguous Allocation**

In contiguous allocation, blocks are stored one after another in consecutive disk locations.

```
Disk:
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 |
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
```

- **Advantages:** Fast access due to physical proximity.
- **Disadvantages:** May lead to fragmentation as files grow.

---

#### **4. Linked Allocation**

In linked allocation, each block contains a pointer to the next block. This allows files to grow dynamically but increases seek time.

```
Disk:
+---------+    +---------+    +---------+
| Block 1 |--->| Block 2 |--->| Block 3 |
+---------+    +---------+    +---------+
```

- **Advantages:** No fragmentation.
- **Disadvantages:** Slower access due to pointer traversal.

---

#### **5. Indexed Allocation**

Indexed allocation uses an index block to store pointers to all the blocks of the file.

```
Index Block:
+---------+---------+---------+
| Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 |
+---------+---------+---------+

Disk:
+---------+ +---------+ +---------+
| Block 1 | | Block 2 | | Block 3 |
+---------+ +---------+ +---------+
```

- **Advantages:** Fast random access.
- **Disadvantages:** Requires extra storage for the index.

---

### **6. Handling Variable-Length Records**

When records are of variable length, special handling is required:

1. **Use Delimiters:**
   - Add special characters (e.g., `|` or `$`) to separate records within a block.
2. **Add Metadata:**
   - Prefix each record with its length to facilitate parsing during retrieval.

Example Block with Variable-Length Records:

```
+--------------------------+
| 4|ABCD  | 6|ABCDEF | ... |
+--------------------------+
```

---

### **7. File System Metadata**

The file system maintains metadata about sequential files, such as:

- File name.
- Start block address.
- Total number of blocks.
- Allocation method (contiguous, linked, or indexed).

---

### **8. Reading from Disk**

To retrieve a sequential file:

1. **Locate the Start Block:** Use file system metadata.
2. **Read Sequentially:**
   - For contiguous allocation, read blocks in order.
   - For linked allocation, follow pointers.
   - For indexed allocation, use the index to fetch blocks.

---

### **Practical Example in Pseudocode**

```c
// Writing a Sequential File to Disk
File f;
Block b;

// Divide file into blocks
while (!EndOfFile(f)) {
    ReadNextRecord(f, record);
    AddRecordToBlock(b, record);

    if (BlockFull(b)) {
        WriteBlockToDisk(b);
        InitializeNewBlock(b);
    }
}

// Save any remaining records
if (!BlockEmpty(b)) {
    WriteBlockToDisk(b);
}
```

# **Sequential File Implementation**

## **Introduction**

Sequential files are fundamental in data management, providing efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms. This project implements sequential files with dynamic memory and persistence support, allowing for robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The implementation supports flexible configurations for handling records and blocks, including features like:

- **Block Organization**: Contiguous (Table) or Linked (List).
- **Order**: Ordered or Unordered records.
- **Record Size**: Fixed or Variable-sized records.
- **Overlap**: Records spanning multiple blocks (Continued) or fully contained within a block (Not Continued).

The program also features a **menu-driven interface** for user interaction, enabling operations like record insertion, updates, deletion, and file persistence on disk.

---

## **Features**

1. **CRUD Operations**:

   - **Insert**: Add new records to the sequential file.
   - **Read**: Display all records or search for a specific record.
   - **Update**: Modify an existing record by its ID.
   - **Delete**: Logically delete a record by marking it as removed.

2. **Persistence**:

   - Save the file to disk in a binary format.
   - Load the file from disk for future use.
   - Delete the binary file from disk.

3. **Configurable File Structure**:

   - Contiguous (Table) or Linked (List) blocks.
   - Ordered or Unordered records.
   - Fixed or Variable record sizes.
   - Support for records with or without block overlap.

4. **Utility Functions**:
   - Print the file in a human-readable tabular format.
   - Binary search for records in ordered files.
   - Logical deletion of records.

```c
typedef struct {
    int id;           // Unique identifier
    char *data;       // Dynamically allocated record data
    int size;         // Size of the record (for variable-length records)
} Record;
```

### **Block**

Represents a fixed-size storage unit containing records.

typedef struct Block {
    char *data;         // Block data (dynamically allocated)
    int blockSize;      // Size of the block
    int freeSpace;      // Remaining space in the block
    struct Block *next; // Pointer to the next block (for linked structures)
} Block;
```

### **Sequential File**

Represents the entire sequential file system, managing blocks and records.

```c
typedef struct {
    Block *head;       // Pointer to the first block
    int blockSize;     // Size of each block
    int isContiguous;  // 1 for Table, 0 for List
    int isOrdered;     // 1 for Ordered, 0 for Unordered

### **How to Modify for Custom Records**

To adapt the program for different record types (e.g., student records), follow these steps:

1. **Update the `Record` Structure**:
   Modify `record.h` to include fields specific to the new use case:

   ```c
   typedef struct {
       int id;           // Unique identifier
       char name[50];    // Student's name
       float gpa;        // Student's GPA
       int age;          // Student's age
   } Record;
   ```

2. **Adjust CRUD Functions**:
   Update the `insertRecord`, `printFile`, `updateRecord`, and `binarySearchInFile` functions to handle the new fields.

3. **Update Display Logic**:
   Modify `printFile` to display the additional fields in a tabular format:

   ```c
   printf("| %-10d | %-20s | %-5.2f | %-3d |\n", record->id, record->name, record->gpa, record->age);
   ```

4. **Recompile the Project**:
   Use `make` to rebuild the program:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make
   ```
